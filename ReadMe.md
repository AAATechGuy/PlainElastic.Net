PlainElastic.Net
=======

The really plain Elastic Search .Net client.

### Idea 

Usually clients built using `Black Box` principle: *there is a client interface and some unknown magic behind it*.<br/>
*(call of the client method internally generate some commands and queries to external system, get responses and somehow process them and then retrieve result to user)*<br/>
As the result user hardly can debug connectivity issues or extend client functional with missed features. 

The main Idea of PlainElastic.Net is to be a `Glass Box`. e.g. provide a full control over connectivity process to user.


### How Its works

1 The only thing you need to connect to ES is a HTTP connection.

  ```csharp
  var connection  = new ElasticConnection();
  ```

2 Than you can write stings with ES command 
  
```csharp
  string command = "http://localhost:9200/twitter/user/test";
```

3 And JSON string with data

```csharp
	string jsonData = "{ \"name\": \"Some Name\" }";
```

4 And pass them using connection to ES.

```csharp
	string response = connection.Put(command, jsonData);
```

5 Get JSON string response and analyze it.

```csharp	
  if(response.Contains("\"ok\":true")) {
	 ... // do something useful
	}
```

#### So, how PlainElastic can help you here?

```csharp
  // 1. It provides ES HTTP connection
  var connection  = new ElasticConnection("localhost", 9200);
  
  // 2. And sophisticated ES command builders:
  string command = Commands.Index(index: "twitter", type: "user", id: test)
  
  // 3. And gives you the ability to serialize your objects to JSON:  
  var serializer = new JsonNetSerializer();
  var tweet = new Tweet { Name = "Some Name" };
  string jsonData = serializer.ToJson(tweet);
  
  // 4. Then you can use appropriate HTTP verb to execute ES command:
  string response = connection.Put(command, jsonData);
  
  // 5. And then you can deserialize operation response to typed object to easily analyze it:
  IndexResult indexResult = serializer.ToIndexResult(result);
  if(indexResult.ok) {
     ... // do something useful.
  }
  
  // 6. And even more: Typed mapping and condition-less query builders.
```
